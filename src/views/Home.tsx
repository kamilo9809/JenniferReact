            I love traveling and discovering new places. Iâ€™ve had the
            opportunity to visit Miami and Orlando, Florida, where I fully
            enjoyed the amazing Disney World theme parks. Iâ€™ve also explored the
            beautiful beaches of Santa Marta and Cartagena, two charming
            destinations on Colombiaâ€™s Caribbean coast. I'm a Barranquilla
            native at heart, but I currently live in MedellÃ­n, a city that has
            inspired me and warmly welcomed me.

            that teach me new things or inspire me. Iâ€™m currently studying
            Advertising Development at SENA, and my goal is to apply that
            knowledge to develop my own business in the future.

            I attached a mind map as evidence for the activity

            continuously learn in both my professional and personal life. This
            comprehensive approach to lifelong learning and staying current

            for the challenges of todayâ€™s world. The tool I used to create the

            describes my region, highlighting its location, characteristics, and

            and pronunciation in English, as well as the ability to organize and

            used the Canvas tool because I enjoy its wide variety of templates,
