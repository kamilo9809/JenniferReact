            I love traveling and discovering new places. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to visit Miami and Orlando, Florida, where
            I fully enjoyed the amazing Disney World theme parks. Iâ€™ve also explored the beautiful beaches of Santa Marta and
            Cartagena, two charming destinations on Colombiaâ€™s Caribbean coast. I'm a Barranquilla native at heart, but I
            currently live in MedellÃ­n, a city that has inspired me and warmly welcomed me.

            or inspire me. Iâ€™m currently studying Advertising Development at SENA, and my goal is to apply that knowledge to
            develop my own business in the future.

            This evidence consists of a personal and professional presentation written in English. It demonstrates my ability
            to describe real-life experiences and future goals using appropriate vocabulary and structure. The text is
            connected to the topics of critical thinking and media literacy, as it reflects thoughtful decision-making about
            my studies, work, and values. Additionally, it indirectly touches on the topic of crime and punishment by showing
            awareness of social responsibilities and ethical behavior, such as working at night to provide customer service
            and being a committed citizen and mother.
